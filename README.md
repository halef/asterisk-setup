# asterisk - Installation and configuration update

This repo contains some scripts I use to install Asterisk with a stripped down configuration. These have been
used for personal projects and it is advisable to review the content of the scripts before running them
yourself.

## Scripts

- install.sh :      Installs asterisk
- update-conf.sh :  Updates asterisk configuration with content of conf/ directory.
